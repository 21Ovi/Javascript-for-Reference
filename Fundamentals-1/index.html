    <h1>Poetry</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Poetry</strong> has a long and varied history, evolving
      differentially across the globeit dates back atleast to prehistoric times
      with hunting poetry in Africa, and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry
      of the empires of the Nile, Niger and Volta River valleys. Some of the
      earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the
      <em>Pyramid Texts</em> written during the 25th century BCE. The earliest
      surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, was
      written in Sumerian.

      Early poems in the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs such as the
      Chinese <em>Shijing</em>; or from a need to retell oral epics, as the
      <em>Sanskrit Vedas</em>, the Zoroastrian <em>Gathas</em>, and the Homeric
      epics, the <em>lliad</em> and th e <em>Odyssey</em>, Ancient Greek
      attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's <em>Poetics</em>, focused
      on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts
      concentrated on features such as repetition, verse formand rhymes and
      emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more
      objectively-informative prosaic writing.
