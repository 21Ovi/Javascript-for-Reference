    <h1>
      Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog
      owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array
      for each). <br />For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a
      dog is an adult or a puppy.<br />
      A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's
      less than 3 years old. <br />Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts
      2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the
      following things:<br />
      1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs
      actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array,
      and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a bad
      practice to mutate function parameters)<br />2. Create an array with both
      Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data<br />
      3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog
      number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is
      still a puppy üê∂")<br />
      4. Run the function for both test datasets <br />HINT: Use tools from all
      lectures in this section so far üòâ <br />TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5,
      2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]<br />
      TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
      GOOD LUCK üòÄ
