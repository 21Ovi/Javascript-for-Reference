      // Coding Challenge #2 and 3 /*<br />
      ,Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. <br />This time, they
      want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of
      the dogs in their study. Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which
      accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in
      order:<br />
      1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if
      the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years
      old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.<br />
      2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the
      same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old) <br />3. Calculate
      the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from
      other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)<br />
      4. Run the function for both test datasets TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15,
      8, 3] TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4] GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */<br />

      Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from the previous challenge,
      but this time as an arrow function, and using chaining! TEST DATA 1: [5,
      2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3] TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4] GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
